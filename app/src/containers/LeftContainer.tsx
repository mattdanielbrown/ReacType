/**
 * The `App` component serves as the main container for a simple application that includes a sidebar
 * and a content area. The sidebar allows for tab selection and toggling the visibility of the content area.
 * The content area displays content based on the selected tab and its visibility state.
 *
 * State management within the component includes:
 * - `activeTab`: Tracks the currently active tab in the sidebar.
 * - `isVisible`: Controls the visibility of the content area.
 *
 * The component uses the `useState` hook to manage these states and provides methods to update them,
 * which are passed down to child components (`Sidebar` and `ContentArea`) as props.
 *
 * @returns {JSX.Element} The main layout of the application, including a sidebar and a content area,
 *                        structured in a flexible display container.
 *
 * This structure facilitates a user interface where interactions in the sidebar affect the content displayed,
 * making it dynamic based on user actions. This pattern is typical for applications requiring a navigation panel
 * alongside content that updates based on user interaction.
